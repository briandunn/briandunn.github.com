title: A portable shell function that lets you call your hosts by name
---
I've been using OpenWRT for a while now, and somehow I keep on reinventing forwarding firewall rules. So here is one that works.  May this be the last time you or I relearn how to forward some ports to a host who gets to keep his name, whether the request comes from within the lan or from without.

I stuck the function in a "gist":http://gist.github.com/513318
